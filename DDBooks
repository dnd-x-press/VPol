This report examines the current process for tracking official diaries and daybooks, from issuance to archiving at VPASC (Victoria Police Archives and Storage Centre). These notebooks record police officers' duties and notes, and their management is subject to specific policies regarding capture, use, tracking, storage, and retention.

The report identifies longstanding difficulties in tracking and locating diaries and daybooks, particularly when needed for official purposes like Royal Commissions. Victoria Police has faced criticism for these records management issues and the time-consuming manual processes involved in locating the physical books.

Background and Methodology

This report was compiled through discussions with various stakeholders, including frontline officers, station staff, specialized units like Homicide Squad, relevant administrative departments, and VPASC staff.

Current Process and Challenges

The official diary register captures diary owner details at issuance and return for storage. However, tracking weaknesses emerge when diaries are not actively used and remain with officers for extended periods. This increases the risk of misplaced or destroyed diaries. Additionally, the register is a localized, standalone record with limited visibility across the organization, hindering reconciliation and reporting efforts.

Scope of the Problem

The report further highlights that only PB13 police diaries are considered accountable documents within the register system. In practice, officers often utilize various digital tools and alternative stationary for contemporaneous notes, exceeding the scope of the current tracking system.
