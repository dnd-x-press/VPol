To convert your existing code into a UserForm with Clear and Close buttons, follow these steps:

1. In Excel, press `ALT + F11` to open the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) editor.

2. In the VBA editor, go to `Insert > UserForm` to create a new UserForm.

3. On the UserForm, add the following controls:
   - Label: For instructions like "Enter the value to search for:"
   - TextBox: For the user to input the search text.
   - ListBox: To display search results.
   - CommandButton: For searching (you can rename it to "SearchButton").
   - CommandButton: For clearing (you can rename it to "ClearButton").
   - CommandButton: For closing (you can rename it to "CloseButton").

4. Customize the appearance and layout of the UserForm as desired.

5. Double-click the "SearchButton" button to open its code window and add your search logic. Use the TextBox for the search value and the ListBox for displaying results. Here's an example of the search logic:

```vbnet
Private Sub SearchButton_Click()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim searchValue As String
    Dim lastRow As Long
    Dim i As Long
    
    ' Set the worksheet where you want to perform the search
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1") ' Replace "Sheet1" with your sheet name
    
    ' Get the search value from the TextBox
    searchValue = TextBox1.Value
    
    ' Clear the ListBox
    ListBox1.Clear
    
    ' Find the last row in Column B
    lastRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, "B").End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Loop through Column B and check for matches
    For i = 1 To lastRow
        If InStr(1, ws.Cells(i, 2).Value, searchValue, vbTextCompare) > 0 Then
            ' Add matching values to the ListBox
            ListBox1.AddItem "Match found in Row " & i & ": " & ws.Cells(i, 2).Value
        End If
    Next i
End Sub
```

6. Double-click the "ClearButton" button to open its code window and add code to clear the search box and the ListBox:

```vbnet
Private Sub ClearButton_Click()
    ' Clear the search box (TextBox)
    TextBox1.Value = ""
    ' Clear the ListBox
    ListBox1.Clear
End Sub
```

7. Double-click the "CloseButton" button to open its code window and add code to close the UserForm:

```vbnet
Private Sub CloseButton_Click()
    ' Close the UserForm
    Unload Me
End Sub
```

8. Save your work and close the VBA editor.

9. To display the UserForm, you can create a button or hyperlink on your Excel worksheet. Assign a macro to that button or hyperlink to show the UserForm.

10. Test the UserForm by clicking the button you created in step 9. It will open the search form, and users can enter search text, search for matches, clear the search box, and close the form.

Remember to replace "Sheet1" with the actual name of your worksheet and customize the UserForm appearance and functionality to meet your specific needs.
