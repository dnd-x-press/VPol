I conducted a thorough search of the intranet and reviewed several real-world examples, but I was unable to find a centralized policy or directive. After consulting with a knowledgeable team member, it was confirmed that there is no single, official policy.

Instead, each work unit, department, and division appears to have its own local process. The general consensus is that a cover sheet is used for any issue that needs to be escalated to a department head, with approvals noted at each level of management.

Key Finding on SharePoint

While searching, I did come across a SharePoint page that serves as a guide for completing an issue cover sheet. This resource, while not a policy itself, highlights that the cover sheet should address the issue and rationale for any legislative or policy review, change, or development. It essentially acts as a template for what information is required.

I believe this page is the closest thing to a directive we have on the intranet and provides a solid framework for what an issue cover sheet should contain.
