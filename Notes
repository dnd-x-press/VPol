Meeting Summary: SharePoint Migration for Watch House
Here's a summary of the meeting in bullet points:

1. Project Goal:
* Create a new, central SharePoint site for managing documents currently located on network shares (S drive) and potentially other locations (One Drive, local drives).
* Improve accessibility and organization of information for Watch House members.

2. Data Migration:
* Question: Can records be migrated from network shares to SharePoint?
* Answer (Elijah): Yes, scripts can be written to migrate documents.
* Challenge (Shane): Significant messy data (unorganized folders, broken links) exists on network shares, requiring cleanup.
* Consideration: Whether to do a pure migration of everything or specific, cleaned-up content.
* Alternative Approach: Make network drives read-only, allowing users to manually drag and drop relevant files to the new SharePoint structure. This allows for a cleaner start but requires user effort.

3. Existing Resources & Requirements:
* Identify existing documents and resources (briefs, ready reckoners, bail system info) that can be reused or need to be integrated into SharePoint.
* Understand user needs for accessing files (e.g., quick access for Watch House members).
* Address the need for multi-tiered access based on roles (members, sergeants, admin).
* Implement lockdown for template document libraries to prevent unauthorized editing.

4. Specific Systems/Data:
* Investigate integrating the B reporting system (currently separate) into SharePoint or linking to it.
* Consider the current system for bail reporting, which includes separate folders for each offender.
* Explore linking to existing "whereabouts" folder/system used across other stations.

5. One Drive:
* Personal One Drives will remain separate and will not automatically sync to SharePoint.
* Users can manually drag and drop files from their One Drive to SharePoint.

6. Records Management (EDRMS):
* An automated Electronic Document and Records Management System (IDRMS) is currently being piloted and will be rolled out organization-wide in a couple of months.
* The IDRMS will sit over existing storage (SharePoint, network drives, One Drive) for retention and discoverability.
* SharePoint setup will prepare for seamless IDRMS integration.

7. Admin & Governance:
* A group will be created for admin users to have oversight and editing access within the SharePoint document library.
* The IDRMS will automate current manual records management processes.

8. Training & Implementation:
* Training will be required for admin staff and management on the new SharePoint structure and potentially the IDRMS.
* Support will be provided to help members adjust to the new system.
* Restricting write access to network drives will encourage adoption of SharePoint.

9. Next Steps & Timeline (Draft):
* Next Few Weeks: Dash will develop a proposed SharePoint structure based on the discussion and gather further input.
* Following Week: Build the initial SharePoint site and library (initially visible only to the building team).
* Subsequent Week: Present the initial site for review and feedback, make amendments.
* Publish: Deploy the SharePoint site.
* Post-Publish: Allow a few days for user familiarization, with ongoing support offered.

10. Ongoing Feedback:
* Nathan will likely canvas members for feedback on their needs and how to make the system more efficient.
