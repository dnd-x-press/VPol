Immediate/Short Term Actions:

Centralized Online Register: Implement a digital register of official diaries (potentially within existing applications like Station Books) for quick and cost-effective tracking.

Member Training & Communication:

Develop an e-learning module on diary maintenance and member obligations.
Create a dedicated SharePoint page with information, FAQs, and VPASC retrieval links.
Implement a bi-annual check-up system for Officers-in-Charge to encourage handing in inactive diaries for storage.
Policy & Practice Reviews:

Consider designating all notebooks as "accountable" to reduce reliance on expensive, bulky diaries.
Formally review electronic diary usage (structure, saving practices, legal implications).
Review current inactive/completed diary archiving timelines in Victoria Police Manuals.
Long Term Recommendations:

Electronic Diaries:

Ensure electronic diaries are "future-proof" for legal retrievals.
Address challenges of electronic diary auditing, discoverability, and version control.
Maintain a central electronic register to facilitate reporting and access for investigations and public inquiries.
Explore registering electronic diaries in Station Books with file details.
VPASC Funding & Resources:

Dedicate a separate team for existing diary amnesty drives to reduce burden on VPASC staff and increase collection frequency.
