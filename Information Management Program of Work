Information Management Program of Work

 This SharePoint page provides an overview of the Information Management (IM) program's current work and progress.

 Overall Program Progress:

[Progress Bar]: Visually represents the overall completion percentage of the IM program initiatives.
 Status of Activities:

[Pie Chart]: This central element shows the breakdown of program activities, categorized by:
Completed: Percentage representing activities successfully finished.
In Progress: Percentage representing activities currently underway.
Not Started: Percentage representing activities yet to be initiated.
 Detailed Activity Breakdown:

Completed Activities:
A bulleted list with brief descriptions and completion dates for finished activities.
In Progress Activities:
Another bulleted list with descriptions, estimated completion dates, and current progress details (e.g., % complete) for ongoing activities.
 Additional Information:

Consider adding a section for "Upcoming Activities," which can briefly outline planned initiatives and estimated start dates.
Include a "Resources" section with links to relevant documents, templates, or training materials related to the IM program.
If applicable, add a "Contact" section with names and contact information for program leads or key personnel.
 Design Tips:

Use a clean and professional layout with clear headings and easy-to-read fonts.
Leverage SharePoint's built-in web parts for progress bars and pie charts.
Utilize color-coding to differentiate between completed, in progress, and not started activities.
Consider incorporating icons or visuals to enhance the user experience.
Ensure the page is mobile-friendly for easy access on any device.


The stakeholder group is asked to:

Confirm the accuracy of the "Land-to-End Mapping" process and the use of diaries and daybooks documented in the Options Discussion Paper (Appendix A).
 Additional Information:

The Options Discussion Paper will be shared with a wider group for feedback (BTP Frontline Forum and Commander Millet). Their feedback will be reported back to the initial stakeholder group.
Once all feedback is received, a report on the process, collection, and use of diaries and daybooks will be prepared for the Digital Transformation Committee.
The Digital Transformation Committee's response will be shared with everyone involved in the mapping process.

Stakeholders Identified Problems with Diaries:

Tracking: No central system tracks issued, active, or inactive diaries. Some use unofficial electronic or paper alternatives.
Practices: Unclear communication and training lead to inconsistencies in issuing, recording, storing, and transferring diaries (both physical and electronic).
Resource Strain: VPASC (Victoria Police Archive Services Centre) lacks resources for diary amnesty drives and digitizing legacy registers.
Ownership: Misunderstanding about diary ownership leads to members not returning them or keeping them indefinitely, causing storage issues.

Improve Diary Tracking and Management:

Real-time Tracking: Capture all physical diaries in ReFind upon issuance for easy discovery.
One Member, One Diary: Assign one active diary per member (non-transferable) to simplify location through ReFind.
Dedicated Record Type: Create a specific "Diaries & Daybooks" record type in ReFind for targeted searches.
Form Review: Revise the End of Service Form 39A to identify any gaps in diary collection.
 Move Towards Electronic Diaries (Future State):

Senior Management Input:
Clarify the current stance on electronic diaries with senior management and Victoria Police Management (VPM).
Align with VPM for a broader staff awareness and training program on electronic diaries.
Cost-Saving Transition: Seek endorsement from senior management to transition towards electronic diaries, reducing workload for members and VPASC, as well as storage costs.
 Member Education and Responsibility:

Ownership Awareness: Increase staff awareness that police activity diaries belong to Victoria Police and must be returned/transferred to VPASC following established guidelines (Information and Records Management Hub & draft IM Policy).
 Potential for Further Improvements:

Additional refinements may be identified during wider engagement with the BTP Frontline Forum and Commander Paul Millet.
